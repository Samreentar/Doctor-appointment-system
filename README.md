Workflow
Patient Booking an Appointment
Patients start by navigating to the Booking Page, where they fill out a form with their name, email, phone number, appointment date, time, selected specialization, and preferred doctor. JavaScript validates the form data in real-time to ensure all fields are correctly filled out. Upon submission, PHP processes this data and stores it in the MySQL database. A confirmation message is sent to the patient, and the selected doctor is notified of the new appointment request.

Doctor Managing Appointments
Doctors register on the Doctor Page by providing their name, email, phone number, and specialization. After registration, they log in and access their dashboard to view pending appointment requests. Doctors can approve or cancel appointments and add remarks for each action. Once an appointment is approved or canceled, the system updates the status in the database and notifies the patient.

Checking Appointment Status
Patients log into the system using their credentials and navigate to the Check Appointment Page to view the status of their appointments. The system displays the status of all appointments (approved, canceled, or pending) along with any remarks from the doctor. Patients can also cancel or reschedule their appointments if needed.

Updating Doctor Profile
Doctors can log in and navigate to their profile page to update their personal details such as contact information and specialization. PHP processes the updated information and saves it to the MySQL database, with the system confirming and reflecting the changes in the doctor’s profile.

Contacting Support
Users can view the company’s contact details, including the address, email, and phone numbers on the Contact Page. They can also fill out a contact form for inquiries or feedback. The form data is processed by PHP and sent to the company’s support team, which reviews and responds to the inquiries.
